# üåê DSON ‚Äì Deep Symbolic Object Notation

**DSON** is a symbolic data language designed for AI-native visual reasoning, modular design, and cultural expression.  
It encodes not just images ‚Äî but visual intelligence itself.

## üìò About

DSON bridges the gap between structured data (like JSON) and symbolic visual logic used in:
- Mandalas, glyphs, and cultural patterns
- Modular design systems
- Generative art and AI co-creation
- Cross-cultural computational heritage
- Visual programming interfaces
